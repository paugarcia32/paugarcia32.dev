## Project Overview

TrafficFlow AI is a real-time vehicle radar system that uses computer vision to detect and count cars in a predefined area, identifying traffic jams and analyzing flow patterns as they happen.

The project was built during **HackBCN**, a 30-hour hackathon, by a team of 3 members. For most of us, it was the first time integrating an AI model into a real project.

## My Role

My responsibilities spanned both ends of the stack. On the AI side, I implemented the YOLOv10 model to detect and count vehicles within a defined region of interest in the video feed. On the frontend side, I built the Next.js client to display the live detection results and traffic analysis in a clear, visual interface.

The biggest challenge was time: learning how to work with YOLOv10, integrate it into a pipeline, and ship a working demo — all within 30 hours and with no prior AI project experience.

## Conclusions

TrafficFlow AI was a first contact with applied AI under real pressure. Going from zero AI project experience to a working YOLOv10 pipeline with a live frontend in 30 hours forced rapid learning and decisive prioritization.

Beyond the technical side, the hackathon context taught us to scope aggressively, cut non-essential features early, and focus energy on what makes a demo convincing. The result was a functional traffic radar that detected vehicles in real time and classified congestion. Given more time, the pipeline could support more camera angles, real traffic feeds, and finer congestion thresholds.
